## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Felix

A Computer Science enthusiast from Rwanda ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼

My interests lie in Operating Systems, Systems Programming, and Machine Learning. I am strongly interested in open-source projects and currently in my early research career. I am looking to explore methods and applications of optimal computing systems in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I've gained experience in different areas of Computer Science, mainly focusing on machine learning. I have worked on projects that involve the design of complex deep-learning algorithms, and over time I am a regular contributor to open-source projects. These experiences have helped me to develop a strong foundation in software development, I am well equipped to make lasting contributions through my work.

I am presently seeking opportunities for collaboration in areas that resonate with my professional interests.
