## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Felix

A Computer Science enthusiast from Rwanda ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼

My interests lie in Operating Systems, Systems Programming, and Machine Learning. I am strongly interested in open-source projects and currently in my early research career. I am looking to explore methods and application of optimal computing systems in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I am presently seeking opportunities for collaboration in areas that resonate with my professional interests.
