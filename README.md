## üëã Hello there! I'm Felix

A lifelong learner and technology enthusiast with a passion for Computer Science and Machine Learning. It took me a good three years to discover my true calling, but now I'm fully immersed in a Computer Science degree, and I couldn't be happier!

I pursued an advanced Diploma in Biomedical Engineering in my early academic journey. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that my heart belonged to computers and coding. The decision to switch paths was a tough one, but it led me to where I am today‚Äîa Computer Science student with an unyielding love for programming and an insatiable curiosity about the world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

I find the field of Machine Learning fascinating, and I'm constantly driven to learn more about its complexities. In pursuit of my passion, I have set my sights on the research path and aspire to make my mark in the ML community. My enthusiasm for learning has led me to acquire high-quality coding skills, with Python being my all-time favourite language üêç. Collaborating with a team of skilled engineers is something I truly cherish as it provides invaluable opportunities to grow and learn together.

Throughout my journey, I've embraced the power of communities. I've learned essential skills from various talented individuals I haven't met in person. Their knowledge has worked wonders for me, and I continue to seek out opportunities to connect with more amazing people in the tech industry.

My primary goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech community and elevate my knowledge to new heights. I am motivated by any opportunity that allows me to learn new skills, tackle unique challenges, gain valuable experiences, and expand my network.

I am always open to a discussion if you are interested in offering me such an opportunity. Let's explore the possibilities of working together and creating something great! üòä

In summary, I am a passionate and dedicated individual, eager to make a difference in the tech world. I am particularly interested in Deep Learning and remain committed to continuous growth and development within the field. üòé

Let's connect and learn from each other, looking forward to meeting new like-minded individuals! üöÄ

My successful experiences so far include:

- Being a Machine learning Research Engineer at [Ivy](https://unify.ai/) Where I am contributing to and maintaining the [Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy) a Unified Machine Learning open-source library. Feel free to join us in the Unification of Machine Learning frameworks.

- Successfully contributed to other open-source projects and still looking forward to contributing to more.
